# Parallelization-of-Durand-Kerner-Algorithm
Durand-Kerner Algorithm is used to find the roots of a N-degree Polynomial which modifies the roots until it converges to its optimal value.This Algorithm
has been optimized by exploiting parallelization techniques of OpenMP,MPI and CUDA's Parallel Programming.
